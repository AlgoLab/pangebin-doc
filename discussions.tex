\subsection{What is the meaning of not using the extremities of the contigs?}

What is the meaning of using just fragments of contig?

So what is the real purpose of the pan-assembly graph?

\subsection{Force alternative flow when reassembling contigs from the same assembler}

Victor: I do not think relevant to force passing through alternative links when the flow enables reassemblies.
As you can reassemble think because there exists a path through a share, that comes from contigs of different assemblers also.

\begin{missingproofbox}
    Is there a share only between contigs of the same assembler?
\end{missingproofbox}

In that case we should differentiate the share, and merge with subcontigs.
