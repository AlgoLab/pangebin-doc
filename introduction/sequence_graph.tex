\begin{definition}{Sequence set}{sequence_set}
  Let \Sequences{} be a set of DNA sequences.
  Each sequence \(s \in \Sequences{}\) is a string of length \(|s|\).
  As a DNA sequence, it can be read in two orientation:
  the forward orientation (original sequence in the set) and the reverse complementary orientation (short in reverse).

  Let \( \Orientations{} = \Set{f, r} \) be the set of sequence orientations (\(f\) for forward and \(r\) for reverse).

  Let \( \OrSeqs{} = \Sequences{} \times \Orientations{} \) be the set of oriented sequences.
  for a sequence \(s \in \Sequences{}\), we can write its associated oriented sequences in \OrSeqs{} \(s_f\) and \(s_r\) for respectively the forward and reverse of \(s\).
