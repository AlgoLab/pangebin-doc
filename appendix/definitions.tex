\section{Supplementary definitions}

\begin{definition}
  {Sequence graph (UG version)}{sequence_graph_ug} Let
  \(G = (V_{t} \cup V_{h}, E_{\Sequences{}} \cup \ELinks{})\) be a multi-undirected
  graph (multigraph) where:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \(\Sequences{}\) is the set of sequences

    \item \(\Links{}\) is the multiset of links between oriented sequences

    \item vertices from \(V_{t}\) and \(V_{h}\) represent respectively the tails
      and heads of the sequences

    \item sequence-edges from \(E_{\Sequences{}}\) represent the sequences and connect
      two extremities of the same sequence (\(E_{\Sequences{}}\) is a perfect
      matching of the vertices)

    \item link-edges from the multi-link-edge set \(\ELinks{}\) represent
      the links between the sequences
  \end{itemize}
