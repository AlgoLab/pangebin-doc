Because of the fragmentation, for a given attribute, we do not have a strict attribute-equivalence between each contig and its corresponding fragment path in the pan-assembly graph.
Formally, if \(\alpha\) is an attribute defined either for the contigs and the fragments, 
\(\exists c \in \Contigs{} \text{ s.t. } \alpha_c \neq \sum_{i \in \Fragments{}(c)} \alpha_i\).
Especially when \(\alpha_c\) is inferior than the sum, if the flow passes through the fragment path corresponding to this contig, we would like to positively correct the sum to obtain \(\alpha_c\).

In what follows, we associate new attributes to the fragments corresponding to the possible positive correction we may add to the objective values.
We then adapt the MILP formulations for the corrections.
