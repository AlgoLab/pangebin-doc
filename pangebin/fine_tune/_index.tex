\subsection{Fine-tuning the MILP formulations}

\begin{todobox}
  Describe fine-tuning for:
  \begin{CheckList}{Task}
    \Task{open}{The GC content penalty}
    \Task{open}{The plasmidness}
  \end{CheckList}
\end{todobox}

Because of the fragmentation, for a given attribute, we do not have a strict attribute-equivalence between each contig and its corresponding fragment path in the pan-assembly graph.
Formally, if \(\omega{}\) is an attribute defined either for the contigs and the fragments, \(\forall c \in \Contigs{}\) the statement \(\omega_c = \sum_{i \in \Fragments{}(c)} \omega_i\) does not necessarily hold.
We interpret this issue differentially in the GC content case (\MGC{} problem) and the plasmidness case (\MPS{} problem).
\Cref{sec:method:mgc:fine_tuned,sec:method:mps:fine_tuned} respectively detail the two issues and propose corrective approaches.

Given a contig \(c \in \Contigs{}\), we say it is active if and only if either for its forward or its reverse the link-arcs defining them in the network are active.
