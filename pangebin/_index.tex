        \item Find max flow
        \item With flow near to max flow, find best GC score
        \item With flow near to max flow, with GC score near to best GC score, find best gene density

Pangebin is based on the PlasBin-flow approach~\cite{manePlasBinflowFlowbasedMILP2023} and adapts its method to be applied to pan-assembly graphs.

However, Pangebin tackles the binning of the fragments with a coarse-to-fine-grain approach in three stages (each one refering to an optimization problem) iteratively applied on smaller pan-assembly graph:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item Find the maximum coverage flow (\MCF{} problem, \Cref{meth:max_coverage_flow}) 
    \item Find the maximum GC probability score (\MGC{} problem)
    \item Find the maximum gene density score (\MGD{} problem)
\end{enumerate}

We model these three subproblems as dedicated flow formulations with Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP):

\begin{itemize}
    \item To keep the direction of the flow along the link-edges in \(E_\Links{}\), we define \(A_\Links{}\) as the set of link-arcs such that each link-edge is doubled according to the two directions and results in two link-arcs.
    \item We add two vertices, \(s\) and \(t\) that are respectively the source and the sink vertices in the network resulting from the augmented pan-assembly graph.
    \item The set \(\VSeed{}\) contains the vertices associated with the seed fragments. 
        The source goes into each vertex in \(\VSeed{}\), and each vertex in \(V\) goes into the sink.
        The set of link-arcs of the network \(A'_\Links{}\) equals to the union \(A_\Links{} \cup \Set{(s, v) \given v \in \VSeed{}} \cup \Set{(v, t) \given v \in V}\).
    \item The fragment coverages define the capacities.
        For each link-arc \(a \in A'_\Links{}\), we define its capacity \(\capacity{a} \in \Reals_{>0}\) equals to the minimum of the coverages of the fragments associated to the vertices. 
        In the case the link-arc connect either the source or the sink, the capacity equals the coverage of the fragment associated to the other vertex.
\end{itemize}

In what follow, we define either a fragment, a contig or an arc to be \enquote{active} if it participates in the solution, i.e. the flow passes through it.

\begin{newfeatbox}
    At the opposite of PlasBin-flow, we split each objective expression into different mono-objective functions that define different optimization problems. 
\end{newfeatbox}

\begin{todobox}
    Describe the update of the graph between the iterations (for the two problems).

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item reduce the coverage
        \item remove from the contig set the contigs for which one of its fragment has a null coverage 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{todobox}
