\subsection{The pan-assembly links}

A link in the multi-link-edge set \(\ELinks{}\) is either of two types:
\begin{description}[style=nextline]
  \item[Pangenome link] A link connecting two fragments from the same contig, thus that can connect:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item two fragments from two contigs of different assemblers
      \item two fragments from two contigs of the same assembler
    \end{itemize}
  \item[Assembly link] A link connecting two fragments from two contigs of the same assembler which were linked in the original assembly graph
\end{description}

\Cref{fig:panasm_multi-edges} illustrates some multi-edge cases.
