\section{PlasBin-multiflow binning method}\label{sec:pbmf}

In this section, we propose a new model for the binning problem to answer the issue raised in the previous section, and make robust the method to the structural plasmid constraints (\Cref{sec:plasmid_structures}).
We first slightly change the definition of the network graph (\Cref{sec:pbf_iterbin:network}) leading to \Cref{sec:pbmf:network}.
