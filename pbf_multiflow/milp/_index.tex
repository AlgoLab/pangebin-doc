\subsection{Mixed Integer Linear Programming model}

In this section we present the MILP model for the multi-binning flow approach, where one flow corresponds to one bin.
The MILP formulation consists in a set of constraints where the right inequality constant arm can change to make correspond the model to the bin properties.
Let \(n \in \Naturals{}\) be the maximum number of bins we can or want to model, and \(1 \leq b \leq n\) thus representing the \(b\)\textsuperscript{th} bin.
The changes of the constraints' constant parts must cover the following states:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Bin \(b\) is active or not (\mfbOn{} or \mfbOff{}).
  \item Bin \(b\) is circular or not (\mfbC{} or \mfbPC{}).
  \item Bin \(b\) contains at least one seed or can be free of seeds (\mfbS{} or \mfbFS{}).
\end{itemize}

We associate a symbol to each state to easily identify to which constant constraint arm corresponds to which state.
The additional symbol \mfbOpti{} means the constraint is only for performance optimization.
