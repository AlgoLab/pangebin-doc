\subsection{Contigs in the assembly-consensus graph}

Given a contig \(c\) in the set of contigs \(\Contigs{} = \Contigs{}_1 \cup \Contigs{}_2\) from the two assemblers (by \(\rev{c}\) we denote the reverse).
In the assembly-consensus graph \(ACG\), there exists a unique sequence \(p_c\) of vertices in \(V\) corresponding to the contig \(c\).

We denote by \(A_\Links{}(p_c)\) or \(A_\Links{}(c)\) the set of directed link-edges (link-arcs) composing contig \(c\).

\begin{notebox}
  By \(A_\Links{}(\rev{c})\) we denote the set of link-arcs composing the reverse of \(c\).
\end{notebox}

For a contig \(c \in \Contigs{}\), \(\Fragments{}(c) \subset \Fragments{}\) is the set of all fragments of \(c\).
