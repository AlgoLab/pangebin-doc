\subsection{Converting the multigraph to a simple graph}

We can convert the original assembly-consensus graph, which is a multigraph, to a simple graph by merging all the multi-arcs in one.

It consists in a priori merging all the multi-links between the fragments.
When the multi-links are of different types, we choose to type the link resulting from the merge as an assembly link.

\begin{notebox}
  Now, for each contig \(c \in \mathcal{C}\), the sets \(A(c)\) and \(A(\rev{c})\) do not contain the multi-arcs but only the arcs resulting from the merge of them, so that \(|A(c)| = |A(\rev{c})| = |\Fragments{}(c)| - 1\).
\end{notebox}

In the following, we consider \(ACG\) to be the simple graph resulting from the merge of the multi-arcs.
